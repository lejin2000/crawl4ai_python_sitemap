# crawl4ai_3.py

## Description

This script is a Python script that crawls web pages from a sitemap and saves the content to a file. It uses the `aiohttp` and `asyncio` libraries for asynchronous web requests and the `xml.etree.ElementTree` library for parsing XML sitemaps. It also uses a custom `AsyncWebCrawler` class from the `crawl4ai` module.

## Usage

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install aiohttp
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    pip install lxml
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python crawl4ai_3.py
    ```

    This will fetch the sitemap from the URL defined in `SITEMAP_URL`, crawl each URL in the sitemap, and save the content to the file defined in `OUTPUT_FILE`.

## Configuration

The following variables can be configured:

*   `SITEMAP_URL`: The URL of the sitemap to crawl. Default is `"http://www.a.com/category-sitemap.xml"`.
*   `OUTPUT_FILE`: The name of the file to save the crawled content to. Default is `"a_category.txt"`.

## Functions

*   `extract_sitemap_urls(sitemap_content)`: Extracts URLs from sitemap XML content.
*   `fetch_sitemap()`: Fetches sitemap content.
*   `crawl_urls(urls)`: Crawls each URL and saves content.
*   `main()`: Main function that fetches the sitemap, extracts URLs, and crawls the URLs.

## Dependencies

*   `asyncio`
*   `aiohttp`
*   `xml.etree.ElementTree`
*   `crawl4ai.AsyncWebCrawler` (This assumes there is a module named crawl4ai with a class AsyncWebCrawler)

## Output

The script saves the crawled content to a text file. Each URL's content is separated by a line of 80 equal signs.
